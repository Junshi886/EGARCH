# EGARCH
Building a volatility prediction strategy using an EGARCH model
Iam new on Github. In my project here  want to adapt a strategy presented in the paper 'Alpha Generation and Risk Smoothing using Managed
Volatility'. Iam currently having problems with the data fitting. The value for the constant C is not what it should be.
